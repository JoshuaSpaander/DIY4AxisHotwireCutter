# DIY4AxisHotwireCutter

This repository contains the files needed to 3D model and 3D print the 4 axis hotwire cutter we have build. It will be updated as in due course.

For generating the .dat files in the correct formatting, we use the in house programmed svg2datConverter which can be found here:

For the g-code generation, we use "Wingwire_1.01" which can be found here: https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3467209-WingWire-4-axis-gcode-freeware

For running the machine, we use grbl-Mega-5X which can be found here: https://github.com/fra589/grbl-Mega-5X

The board used is the MKS Gen L V1.0 with a standard PC power supply.
